The extension:

- Runs entirely in your browser
- Only communicates with Trello's own API (trello.com) to read and save card descriptions
- Does not send data to any third-party servers
- Does not use analytics or tracking
- Does not store any data outside of your browser

All functionality operates locally within the context of the Trello website you are viewing.
